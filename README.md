Dear Visitor,

I'm an Australian software engineer currently based in Vancouver, Canada. My passion is building software that enhances human connection and relationships.

The way software can create space for the user is fascinating. Software can empower people to think in new ways, facilitate self-discovery and explore the relationship between us and the world. I believe that software should aim to expand human awareness over profit maxing.

I currently spend my time building [LetterDesk.app](https://www.letterdesk.app), a digital space that allows people to explore human experience together through letter writing and deep connection.

I'm writing for [Boundless.Garden](https://www.boundless.garden).

If you're building software that aims to make the world better, expand how people think, or offers a new perspective on the human experience and you would like to talk to me, [please get in touch](mailto:zaymon.antonio@protonmail.com).

Regards,

Zaymon
